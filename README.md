Python Basics
What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.

Python is a high-level, readable programming language favored for its simplicity and versatility. Key features include:

Ease of Learning: Simple syntax suitable for beginners.
Expressive: Concise code enhances productivity.
Versatility: Supports various programming paradigms.
Rich Standard Library: Extensive modules for diverse tasks.
Use Cases:

Web Development: Django and Flask frameworks.
Data Science: NumPy, Pandas for data analysis.
Automation: Scripting for system tasks.
Education: Teaching programming concepts effectively.
Installing Python
Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.

Installation Steps:

Windows: Download installer from python.org, select "Add Python to PATH" during installation.
macOS: Use Homebrew (brew install python3) or download from python.org.
Linux: Use package manager (sudo apt install python3 for Debian/Ubuntu).
Verify Installation:

Open terminal/command prompt and type python --version or python3 --version.
Setting Up Virtual Environment:

Install virtualenv using pip: pip install virtualenv.
Create a virtual environment: virtualenv myenv.
Activate virtual environment:
Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate
macOS/Linux: source myenv/bin/activate
Python Syntax and Semantics
Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.

python
Copy code
# Simple Python program
print("Hello, World!")
Syntax Elements:
print(): Function to display output.
"Hello, World!": String literal enclosed in double quotes.
Data Types and Variables
List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script demonstrating variables of different types.

Data Types:
Integer (int): Whole numbers.
Float (float): Decimal numbers.
String (str): Textual data.
Boolean (bool): True or False.
python
Copy code
# Python script demonstrating data types
num1 = 10  # integer
num2 = 3.14  # float
name = "Alice"  # string
is_valid = True  # boolean

print(num1, num2, name, is_valid)
Control Structures
Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an if-else statement and a for loop.

Conditional Statements:
python
Copy code
# Example of if-else statement
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 5")
Loops:
python
Copy code
# Example of for loop
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
Functions in Python
What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that adds two numbers and returns their sum. Include an example of calling this function.

Functions: Blocks of code for specific tasks, promoting code reuse.
python
Copy code
# Function to calculate sum
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

# Example of calling the function
result = add_numbers(3, 5)
print("Sum:", result)  # Output: Sum: 8
Lists and Dictionaries
Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script demonstrating basic operations on both.

Lists: Ordered collections.
Dictionaries: Unordered key-value pairs.ython-
